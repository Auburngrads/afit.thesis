abstract: >
  
  Many organizations are concerned, and struggle, with personnel management. Training 
  personnel is expensive, so there is a high emphasis on understanding why and 
  anticipating when individuals leave an organization. The military is no exception. 
  Moreover, the military is strictly hierarchical and must grow all its leaders, 
  making retention all the more vital.

  Intuition holds that there is a relationship between the economic environment and 
  personnel attrition rates in the military (e.g. when the economy is bad, attrition is 
  low). This study investigates that relationship in a more formal manner. Specifically, 
  this study conducts an econometric analysis of U.S. Air Force officer attrition rates 
  from 2004-2016, utilizing several economic indicators such as the unemployment rate, 
  labor market momentum, and labor force participation. Dynamic regression models are used 
  to explore these relationships, and to generate a reliable attrition forecasting 
  capability.

  This study finds that the unemployment rate significantly affects U.S. Air Force 
  officer attrition, reinforcing the results of previous works. Furthermore, this study 
  identifies a time lag for that relationship; unemployment rates were found to affect 
  attrition two years later. Further insights are discussed, and paths for expansion of 
  this work are laid out.

  I am incredibly grateful to my advisor, Dr. Hill, for getting on my case when I needed 
  it and, above all else, for being patient.
  
  I also want to thank my sponsor, the Strategic Analysis branch of the Force 
  Management Division of Headquarters Air Force (HAF/A1XDX) for providing the personnel 
  data and research guidance.
